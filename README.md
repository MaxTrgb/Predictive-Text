Develop a Windows Forms application that will simulate a mobile phone when writing SMS using the T9 dialing method.

While typing in the window, a key press should start/wake up a thread which,
running through the dictionary (create independently), selects the first corresponding word by combination of letters
and offers it to the user. The user can either accept or continue typing.
It should be possible for the user to add a missing word to the dictionary.
